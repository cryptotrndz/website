🔹Cardano’s open interest surged to 1,963,030,303 ADA in a single day, underscoring its growing liquidity credentials.  BlackRock’s recent divestment steepened the Bitcoin and Ethereum downturn, releasing $671 million in redemptions.  Meanwhile, two major ETF funds peaked in 2026, yet they shed $1.7 billion, signaling caution among institutional investors.

#### *🔖  Analysts & Predictions:* 

🔹Bitcoin analysts project a climb near $78K, but red‑flag charts anticipate a $107K upside and a head‑and‑shoulders risk.

A predictive contest between AceTrader and Myriad promised precise short‑term XRP forecasts but remains to be proven.
